        Contact React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript
        library for building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an
        open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the
        view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.React uses a
        declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your
        application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs
        simple views for each state in your application, and React will
        efficiently update and render just the right component when your data
        changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and
        easier to debug.
